Everything in our program is complete and all of the necessary functionalities are in a working state. 

We did not have to do any design changes in our previous code. All we did was add more classes/interfaces 
for implementing the new necessary functionalities. We kept our design from the previous hw assignment the same.

The only thing we changed from the previous homework was the importing method. The only change we made was 
that we changed the filepath  from our computer's filepath location to a set file location in the res folder 
that will work on any computer.
